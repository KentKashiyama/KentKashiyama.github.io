I am Kent Kashiyana, currently a student at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I am working towards a biochemistry major and look forward to various research opportunities and work opportunities in the pharmaceutical industry. I also like to play video games with friends, and draw occasionally, although the latter is something that needs improvement.
